An example of this is the self-sufficiency index, defined with the aim of highlighting the propensity of each individual municipality for energy independence from distributed generation RES plants that are operating in the same area.</p><div><img src=\"/public/img/shutterstock_1494218021.jpg\" style=\"width:640px;height:427px;\"></div>",
